## GitHub Pages
This repository includes a simple [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) site
under the `docs/` folder. The page lists sample events loaded from
`events.json` and sorts them by date. After pushing your changes to GitHub,
enable Pages from the repository settings, choosing the `docs` directory as the
source. Once enabled your site will be available at
`https://<username>.github.io/<repository>/`. Update `docs/events.json` with
your own data and the page will list the events in date order automatically.
